In master-slave mode, once one node fails, the failure would be cascaded all the way down to all of its slave-descendants. To resolve this concern, the Pub/Sub system must develop a way to find a replacement once its master went offline. Therefore, the researchers implemented a leader-election protocol on top of Pub/Sub system using Raft, which provides a less performant yet more reliable replication scheme for Pub/Sub. In this mode, all nodes are identified as \textbf{peer}, and the all could become the \textbf{leader} of the cluster once they win a majority of the ballots in leader election. The non-leader nodes are known as \textbf{follower}, and if they want to become the leader of the node they would first identity themselves as \textbf{candidate} to initiate an election.
