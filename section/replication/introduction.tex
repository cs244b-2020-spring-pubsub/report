Although single-machine implementation could achieve acceptable performance, its capacity upper-bound is strictly limited by the computing power and storage space of the machine hosting it, and one must upgrade the hosting machine to scale up, which could be rather expensive. Following implementations provides ways to scale up the overall service capacities of the system by replicating and coordinating service process onto multiple machines. The machines involved in a distributed Pub/Sub systems are called \textbf{nodes}, and all nodes form a \textbf{cluster} that implements the functions of Pub/Sub systems.
