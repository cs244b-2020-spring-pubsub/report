Scaling remains one of the hardest problem in computer science and software engineering. Through this project, the researchers learned that different scaling approaches has its own comparative advantages: master-slave architecture could be one way to extend system performance; meanwhile leader election could be another way to improve system reliability. However, learning the advantages is not yet enough, the researchers also developed some thinking on how Pub/Sub and scaling could be further optimized in future.

First, the testing strategy adapted throughout the research mostly focused on subscribing side. Subscribe have to keep a long-lasting socket with Pub/Sub servers, but publish is more of a short-lived request but could take place frequently. Given current architectures, where all publish requests are essentially routed to a leader machine, when the publish traffic is at high level the performance of the system could be very different. Hence, how to scale up publish requests still remains an interesting problem that can be better addressed.

Second, after this project the researchers have the idea that the future of scaling solutions should be hybrid of multiple approaches. The essence of a distributed system is the topology it forms; therefore the system users should be able to manipulate such structure however they want to most efficiently solve the problems they need to tackle. Hence, if a distributed system solution could be configured to easily adapt multiple replication strategies, it is likely to be preferred by more users. While developing this system, the researchers attempted to extract the scaling functions as a set of standard interfaces, and the side-car services could just implement the interface. If this goal were to be achieved, the Pub/Sub system the researchers have designed could be able to provide multiple means of replication strategies on a single node. But this idea was eventually unapproachable due to the fact that Pub/Sub implementation needs to be written, such as rerouting publish requests to masters, in different replication strategies so that the strategy could work. In order to achieve the proposed idea, the Pub/Sub base API should be better designed so it has the flexibility to fit the requirements of replication strategies.
