Publisher/Subscriber (Pub/Sub) is an asynchronous messaging-oriented service that serves as the backbone of contemporary distributed systems. In many cases it is used to decouple the functions of a massive monolithic application by aggregating multiple smaller yet more cohesive services. Being such a critical component to distributed systems, Pub/Sub services should also be scalable so it could fit the requirement of the services that depend on it. This project aims to replicate the functions of a pub/sub service with the capabilities to horizontally scale onto multiple machines to better serve the distributed systems it supports.
